**Mentoring**

**Joe DiRenzo (M.S. student)** -- Guided in species distribution
modeling analysis and contextualizing results.

**Devon Gaydos (Ph.D. student)** -- Mentored and helped familiarize with
being a graduate student in the program and in the sudden oak death
disease system.

**Amelia Johnson (REU student)** -- Mentored and demonstrated designing
landscape-scale field experiments, data collection, relational database
management, and statistical analysis.

**Steven Cabrera (undergraduate)** -- Trained and supervised Steven in
field methods for ecological forest measurements and estimating tick
abundances, data organization, management, and analysis using R
software.

**Taylor Clark (M.S. student)** -- Guided in analyzing data collected to
assess the environmental correlates influencing the distribution and
abundance of cogongrass in Florida.

**Elena Meyer (undergraduate)** -- Trained and supervised in field
methods for ecological forest measurements, estimating tick abundances,
and identifying common tick species. I learned a number of botanical
species from Elena.

**Trained and supervised eight others (undergraduates, graduates, and
postdocs) in field methods, data collection, entry, and organization:**
Elizabeth White (UG), Christina Harden (UG), Alison Ochs (UG), Derek Van
Berkel (Postdoc), Lindsey Smart (Ph.D), Steve Johnston (M.S.), Kerry
Wininger (M.S.), Sarah Haas (Ph.D.)
